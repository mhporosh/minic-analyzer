# MiniC Analyzer

A lightweight static analyzer for a Mini-C language using Bison (parser) and Flex (lexer). Parse input programs and emit analysis diagnostics such as undeclared usage, use-before-initialization, and unused variables.

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 (default shell)
- Bison (e.g., GNU Bison or WinFlex-Bison)
- Flex (e.g., GNU Flex 2.5.x)
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc` from MinGW or MSYS2)

> Tip: On Windows, WinFlex-Bison provides `bison.exe` and `win_flex.exe`. If you already have `flex.exe` in `C:\GnuWin32\bin`, you can use that too.

## Quick Start

Run these commands from the project root (`MiniC-Analyzer`):

```powershell
bison -d minic.y
flex minic.l
gcc minic.tab.c lex.yy.c -o minic
```

Analyze the sample programs:

```powershell
minic.exe < test1.c
minic.exe < test2.c
minic.exe < test3.c
minic.exe < test4.c
minic.exe < test5.c
```

## Notes & Troubleshooting

- If `flex` reports rule errors, ensure you are using GNU Flex 2.5.x or `win_flex` from WinFlex-Bison. You can try:

  ```powershell
  win_flex minic.l
  gcc minic.tab.c lex.yy.c -o minic
  ```

- Make sure your toolchain binaries are in `PATH`. Example:

  ```powershell
  $env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\winflexbison"
  $env:Path += ";C:\MinGW\bin"
  ```

- Build artifacts:
  - `minic.tab.h` and `minic.tab.c` are generated by Bison.
  - `lex.yy.c` is generated by Flex.
  - `minic.exe` is the analyzer.

## Project Structure

- `minic.y` — Bison grammar and analyzer logic
- `minic.l` — Flex lexer for tokens
- `test*.c` — Sample Mini-C programs to analyze

## What It Checks

- Undeclared variable or array usage
- Use-before-initialization warnings
- Unused variable warnings
